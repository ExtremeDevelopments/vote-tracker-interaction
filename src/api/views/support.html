        <p class="q">1. How can I show custom links and statistics in the vote embed?</p>
        <p class="a">Feel free to try out our message replacements stated in our documentation [here]!</p>
        <p class="q">2. What is Vote Tracker+?</p>
        <p class="a">Explain what the bot is here.</p>
        <p class="q">3. What information does the bot take when I run /setup?</p>
        <p class="a">When running the setup command, the only information that is stored is your guild ID and the
          channel
          ID that you provide. No further information is held unless given using configuration commands.</p>
        <p class="q">4. I lost votes randomly or my vote never came through, what can I do?</p>
        <p class="a">Feel free to join our support server and contact a staff member about this and we can look into the
          issue for you! We understand that votes are important to many users so we don't want you to miss any!</p>
